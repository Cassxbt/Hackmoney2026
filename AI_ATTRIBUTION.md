# AI Attribution

This project was built with assistance from Claude (Anthropic's AI), specifically the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model accessed via Claude Code.

## How AI Was Used

### Code Generation

Claude generated the majority of the TypeScript implementation:

**Files generated by AI:**
- `src/index.ts` — MCP server entry point and tool definitions
- `src/lib/config.ts` — Configuration management
- `src/lib/wallet.ts` — Wallet creation and management
- `src/lib/balance.ts` — Circle Gateway integration for unified balance
- `src/lib/paymaster.ts` — Circle Paymaster integration for gas-free transactions
- `src/lib/nitrolite.ts` — Yellow Nitrolite SDK integration for state channels (440 lines)
- `src/tools/balance.ts` — Balance tool handler
- `src/tools/send.ts` — Send tool with ENS resolution
- `src/tools/address.ts` — Address retrieval tool
- `src/tools/channel.ts` — State channel tool handlers

**Estimation:** ~90% of TypeScript code was generated by AI.

### Architecture & Design Decisions

**Human decisions:**
- Project concept: "Payment layer for AI agents"
- MCP as the interface layer (over REST API or GraphQL)
- Target sponsor selection: Yellow ($15K) + Circle ($10K) + ENS ($5K)
- Base Sepolia as primary chain (compatibility research)
- State channels as core differentiator
- Tool API design: `agentpay_balance`, `agentpay_send`, `agentpay_open_channel`, etc.
- Demo flow and narrative structure

**AI contributions:**
- Implementation approach for each tool
- Library selection (viem, @erc7824/nitrolite, etc.)
- Error handling patterns
- Type definitions and interfaces

### Research & Analysis

**Human:**
- Read HackMoney rules and judging criteria
- Analyzed 50+ past ETHGlobal winners (documented in `/Users/apple/Downloads/HackMoney2026_Winning_Projects_Analysis.md`)
- Researched all 6+ sponsor bounties
- Verified SDK compatibility across chains
- Tested wallet setup and initial transactions

**AI:**
- Provided code examples from documentation
- Suggested integration patterns
- Helped structure project architecture

### Debugging & Problem-Solving

Claude assisted with debugging:
- Yellow ClearNode WebSocket authentication flow (EIP-712 domain name requirement)
- Circle Paymaster UserOperation construction
- ENS resolution via mainnet vs L2
- viem type compatibility with Nitrolite SDK
- WebSocket message handling and timeouts

**Human validation:**
- Tested each integration end-to-end
- Verified transactions on Base Sepolia explorer
- Confirmed WebSocket connection stability
- Validated ENS resolution with real .eth names

### Documentation

**AI-generated:**
- Code comments
- Initial README structure
- Function-level documentation

**Human-written:**
- `HACKMONEY_STRATEGY.md` — full project strategy and research
- `SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md` — hackathon submission checklist
- This attribution document
- Demo video script

## Human Contributions

1. **Strategy & Planning**
   - Defined project scope and goals
   - Selected sponsor targets based on prize pools and competition
   - Prioritized features for hackathon timeline

2. **Technical Decisions**
   - Chose tech stack (MCP SDK, Nitrolite, Circle APIs, ENS)
   - Selected Base Sepolia for maximum compatibility
   - Decided on state channels as key differentiator

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Created test wallet and funded with testnet USDC
   - Executed first Paymaster transaction manually
   - Verified all tool outputs via Claude Desktop
   - Tested ENS resolution with live .eth names
   - Validated WebSocket connection to Yellow ClearNode

4. **Quality Control**
   - Reviewed all generated code for correctness
   - Identified bugs and requested fixes
   - Ensured code follows best practices
   - Validated integration points work correctly

5. **Demo & Submission**
   - Designed demo flow (problem → solution → live demo → numbers)
   - Wrote submission form content
   - Recorded demo video (to be completed)
   - Final testing and polish

## Methodology

This was a collaborative human-AI workflow:

1. **Human** provides high-level requirements and context
2. **AI** generates implementation code
3. **Human** reviews, tests, and provides feedback
4. **AI** fixes bugs and refines based on feedback
5. **Human** validates final functionality and approves

Example workflow for Circle Paymaster integration:
- Human: "Integrate Circle Paymaster for gas-free USDC sends"
- AI: Generated `src/lib/paymaster.ts` with UserOperation construction
- Human: Tested, found signature issues
- AI: Fixed signature generation and gas estimation
- Human: Validated with live transaction, confirmed working

## Code Attribution by Section

### Fully AI-Generated
- All TypeScript implementation files (`src/**/*.ts`)
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Error handling logic
- WebSocket message handling

### Human-Designed, AI-Implemented
- MCP tool API (human designed tool names/parameters, AI implemented handlers)
- State channel flow (human decided on 3-tool approach, AI implemented)
- ENS integration (human specified mainnet resolution, AI implemented)

### Fully Human
- Project strategy documents
- Sponsor research and analysis
- Git commit strategy
- Submission form content
- Demo video (to be recorded)

## Disclosure

We are transparent about AI's role in this project:
- AI accelerated development significantly (would take 5-7 days without AI, took 2 days with AI)
- AI did not operate autonomously — every line of code was human-reviewed
- All architectural decisions were made by humans
- All testing and validation was performed by humans
- The project concept, strategy, and submission are human-driven

This project demonstrates productive human-AI collaboration: AI handles implementation details while humans provide vision, strategy, and quality control.

## Tools Used

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** via Claude Code (Anthropic)
- **Claude Desktop** for MCP testing
- **GitHub Copilot** — NOT used
- **ChatGPT** — NOT used
- Other AI tools — NONE

All AI assistance came from Claude (Anthropic).
